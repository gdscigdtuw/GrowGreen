`Grow Green` that allows contributors worldwide to create awareness about environment and do their bit by contributing.

## About GrowGreen

✅We will make an Eco website or Web App(preferred) that can find nearest nursery, plant shop, organic shop etc like everything related to planting and agriculture, small scale or big scale.

✅It will have a panel of Blogs and posts for these topics.People can post their efforts towards Environment. 

✅We will include personal reminders(alarm) for contributing towards Environment. For example, daily reminders to water the plants or monthly reminders to sow seeds.etc

✅I've seen there is no website or app as such.which have all the features. 

✅To this we can also add giving virtual rewards like coins, from which they can buy plants or help plant one ( anything similar). Rewards to those who post any contribution with a selfie increasing the community bonding for the love of environment.

✅(Future scope for this website) 
After this we can also include a panel for soil testing and all.. that can include ML/Data Mining.
